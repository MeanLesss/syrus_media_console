If the file is not being saved to your desired path, there could be several reasons for this. One possibility is that the path you specified is incorrect or does not exist. You can check if the directory exists by calling the exists() method on a File object representing the directory. Here’s an example code snippet that shows how to do this:

String path = "src/main/webapp/files/videos";
File directory = new File(path);
if (!directory.exists()) {
    System.out.println("Directory does not exist");
}
Another possibility is that your program does not have permission to write to the specified directory. You can check if you have write permission by calling the canWrite() method on a File object representing the directory. Here’s an example code snippet that shows how to do this:

String path = "src/main/webapp/files/videos";
File directory = new File(path);
if (!directory.canWrite()) {
    System.out.println("No write permission");
}
If neither of these is the issue, could you provide more details about your problem so I can better assist you?
